            (Mentor: <I>Dr. Anirban Bandyopadhyay  (Senior research scientist, NIMS  JAPAN) </I> )</font>
			
                   <li>Worked on development of fourth circuit element (Hinductor H - made by series combination of capacitor in spiral arrangement) other 
                   than fundamental element of electronics devices- Resistor R, Capacitor C, Inductor L</li>
                   <li>Examined the characteristic properties of fourth circuit element like pitch, diameter, length & crystal variation for different capacitor</li>
				   <li>Programmed Magnetic field distribution of spiral in MATLAB & IR Imaging of spiral for different crystal arrangement of capacitor</li> 
				   <li>Analysed the frequency spectrum of different kind of crystal arrangements of spiral for AC, DC & White noise</li></div></span>

            (Mentor: <I>Prof. Rajesh M. Hegde  (Dept. of electrical engineering, IIT Kanpur)</I> )</font>
                  <li>Studied various methods of wireless sensor node localisation (Node ranging and positioning) and implemented it on Lab View.
                  <li>Performed the test using three unit of National Instrument WSN node as anchor and NI WSN gateways as mobile node</li>
                  <li>Moved the mobile node in time step to simulate vehicle in motion and obtained RSSI data at each position by the mobile unit</li>
                  <li>Analysed the performance and error rate in the localisation of nodes using three and five anchor nodes for better positioning  </li></div></span>

            (Mentor: <I>Prof. Tanaya Guha  (Dept. of electrical engineering, IITK)</I> )</font>
                  <li>The goal of this project is to develop a contact less drowsy detection technique using grayscale image as it does not require any visible illumination light to be projected on driver eyes and hence does not put any strain on driverâ€™s eyes. Our model uses t ime proportion of closing of eyes to measure the drowsiness state of the driver and do real time tracking of this state. If the proportion exce eds certain threshold, then system sounds an alarm to alert the driver. The whole real time implementation will be done in MATLAB</li></div></span>
